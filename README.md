## To Do or Not To Do - TODO list app
> *My love for Angular came alive during this project.. when I figured out I could add an Angular inline-edit package.*

### Week 7 Assignment
**Mission**: Create a TODO list app which allows a user to add, edit, delete, or complete an item.

##### TODO:
 - ~~Create a TODO item when the user submits the form~~
 - ~~Clicking on an item's text allows the user to edit the item inline~~
 - ~~Clicking on the circle of an item toggles whether it is complete or not~~
 - ~~Clicking on "X" deletes the item~~
 - ~~Display incomplete item number~~
 - ~~Clicking on "Active" shows incomplete items~~
 - ~~Clicking on "Completed" shows complete items~~
 - ~~Clicking on "All" shows all items~~
 - ~~Clicking "Clear completed" removes any todo item that is marked complete~~
  - ~~Remove from from page and localStorage~~
